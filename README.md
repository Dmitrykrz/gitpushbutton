### in a world where everything is virtual, donâ€™t you want something real to slam on your desk instead of typing a command?
git push is such a powerful command, but typing it feel underwhelming. I wanted it to feel more dramatic.
I created a big red button to do exactly that. Press it, and it sends git push and Enter.

# Instructions:
1. Order arduino leonardo board (or any other board with ATmega32U4)
2. Order nice big button. I got mine on aliexpress. Search for "Button 30mm". 30mm indicates the hole diameter in which the button is installed.
3. 3d print 2 files from Hardware folder. Prints with no suports.
4. Sand the print if needed. Apply soap around letters. Smear silicone. Wait to cure. Remove silicone with your hand in warm runnig water.
5. Solder two wires from the button to pin GND and pin 2.
6. Load a software from Software folder using Arduino IDE.
7. Use 2 cable ties to attach a cable to cover.
8. Use M3 heat inserts to attach cover. Or simply glue the cover forever.
